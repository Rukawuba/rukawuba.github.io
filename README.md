I have not updated this in a very long time. I think I will begin to work on this all over again. Let's see how we can work on some newer technologies. 

Languages that are currently used are.. HTML, CSS, Javascript.
Languages I am looking to expand and work here with.. C# .NET, React, Angular?

Data Science will be included, by more sites to be published first
