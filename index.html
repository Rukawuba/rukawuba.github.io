                <h3>Basketball Hall of Fame Predictation Model</h3>
                <p>
				This project is a predictive model built using Logistic Regression to determine whether a player will be inducted into the Hall of Fame.
				 The model utilizes statistical data from both past and present players to make predictions.

				Dataset
				The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of various features from player career statistics.
				Each record in the dataset represents a player, with a binary label indicating whether the player has been inducted into the Hall of Fame or not. 
				The data has been taken from the NBA API from various tables and then combined to analyze each player's career and determine whether they have a career that would leave them in the Hall of Fame.

				Model
				The predictive model is built using Logistic Regression, a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks. 
				Logistic Regression calculates the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class (in this case, whether a player will make the Hall of Fame or not) using players who are already currently in the Hall of Fame as a baseline metric.
